This is a short note describing how backpropagation is performed in a convolutional neural network.

Backpropagation through the convolution and max pooling operations of a convolutional network seems like a mathematical nightmare, which is best left to the deep learning libraries to perform under-the-hood! However, on a closer look, you realize that it is not as complicated as you first imagined, and the expressions turn out to have a neat and elegant form.
